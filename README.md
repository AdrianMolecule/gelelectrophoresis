3 mm acrylic gel box and power V0.pdf contains the model files for lasercutting gel box, gel box power and a tube holder on a 24x12 inch 1/8 inch thick acrylic sheet.
You need a special acrylic glue (it's said this glue welds) and a needle applicator to glue this together.
The glue dries very fast so you have only seconds to connect things properly. Before gluing build the box holding it with masking tape and rememeber or mark on the part what part goes where and if it's over or under another part. 
Watch a couple of videos on how to glue acrylic. You will avoid a lot of headache by doing that. Apparently, you can use aluminum foil to minimize the glue sticking to wrong parts including your fingers.
Test with water that the box is watertight. If a leak is detected add more glue with the applicator.

Warning!! don't wash with hot water as the glue lines will crack due to mechanical tensions. Apparently you can avoid that by "cooking" the box in an oven or broiler-oven for quite a while. I did not do that, just avoided washing with hot water.
